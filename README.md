# Projects
### <span style="color:blue">Bank Customer Churn Prediction</span>
_Model Deployment Course Midterm Exam_ [Project Link](https://github.com/aliciajocelyn/Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction)

This project is part of my Midterm Exam for the Model Deployment Course. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to churn based on their attributes. By doing so, the bank can implement targeted strategies to retain customers, reduce churn rates, and improve overall customer satisfaction. I developed a customer churn model using SMOTE to address class imbalance and implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. After training and selecting the best model, we deployed it with a user-friendly interface via Streamlit.

### <span style="color:blue">Bank Customer Deposit Prediction</span>
_Model Deployment Course Final Exam_ [Project Link](https://github.com/aliciajocelyn/Bank-Deposit-Prediction)

A bank is experiencing revenue decline due to many clients not investing in long-term deposits. To tackle this, the bank aims to identify customers likely to subscribe to these deposits. I will use machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that forecasts which customers are most likely to engage, enabling targeted marketing strategies. The application will be deployed using FastAPI for my Model Deployment class final exam in the 4th semester.

Forecasted stock prices using LSTM, optimizing performance by fine-tuning layers.

### <span style="color:blue">Batik Pattern Classification</span>
_Deep Learning Group Final Project_ [Project Link](https://github.com/aliciajocelyn/Batik-Classification)

This project is part of my final group project for the 4th semester Deep Learning course. Our objective is to classify batik patterns using deep learning techniques. Batik, a traditional textile art form, is internationally recognized and features intricate patterns. However, manually identifying specific batik patterns is a challenging task due to the vast number of similar designs. To address this, we employed transfer learning with EfficientNet B2 to build an effective model for batik pattern classification.

### <span style="color:blue">Bank Personal Loan Prediction</span>
_Deep Learning Course Midterm Exam_ [Project Link](https://github.com/aliciajocelyn/Bank-Personal-Loan-Prediction)

This project was part of my midterm exam for the Deep Learning course in my 4th semester. The objective was to develop a predictive model that determines whether a personal loan application should be approved or rejected. The bank provided customer data, including demographic details, account information, and transaction history, which was used to build a binary classification model. The goal is to classify each loan application as either "accepted" or "rejected" based on the likelihood of repayment. This helps the bank make more accurate lending decisions, reducing risk while improving customer service.

### <span style="color:blue">Online Clothing Store Customer's Yearly Spending Prediction</span>
[Project Link](https://github.com/aliciajocelyn/Online-Clothing-Store-Prediction)

This regression problem aims to predict customers' Yearly Amount Spent in an online clothing store based on their usage patterns and membership details.
The dataset includes behavioral data from the app and website, such as time spent and average session length. Analyzing these factors will help the company understand customer spending better, enabling effective marketing strategies and improved product recommendations, ultimately enhancing engagement and sales.
